## Next Steps to Complete

To finish the core project implementation, follow these steps:

1. **Initialize the Project**
   ```bash
   # Create the basic project structure
   ./scripts/init-project.sh
   ```

2. **Sync Models and Configurations**
   ```bash
   # Sync models and configurations from original project
   ./scripts/sync-from-original.sh
   ```

3. **Start the Development Environment**
   ```bash
   # Build and start the containers
   ./scripts/start-codexcontinue.sh
   ```

4. **Verify Ollama Model**
   ```bash
   # Check if the CodexContinue model was built correctly
   ./scripts/check_ollama_model.sh
   ```

5. **Implement Core Application Logic**
   - Migrate backend API routes from original project
   - Implement frontend UI components
   - Connect ML service with backend API

6. **Test the System**
   - Verify inter-service communication
   - Test ML model integration
   - Ensure Ollama model responds correctly

## Important Implementation Details

### Ollama Model Integration

The Ollama integration is a key component that provides learning capabilities to the system:

1. **Model Definition**: Located at `ml/models/ollama/Modelfile`
2. **Volume Mapping**:
   ```yaml
   volumes:
     - ollama-data:/root/.ollama
     - ./ml/models/ollama:/models/ollama
   ```
3. **Model Building**: Done by `ml/scripts/build_codexcontinue_model.sh`
4. **Customization**: Different models can be created for domain-specific use cases

### Docker Service Configuration

Each service is configured with appropriate settings:

1. **Backend**: FastAPI service with API endpoints and business logic
2. **Frontend**: Streamlit UI for user interaction
3. **ML Service**: Flask service with ML model integration
4. **Redis**: Caching and messaging
5. **Ollama**: Local LLM service with custom model

### Environment Variables

Critical environment variables to configure:

1. **Backend**:
   - `REDIS_URL`: URL for Redis connection
   - `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`: URL for Ollama API

2. **ML Service**:
   - `OLLAMA_API_URL`: URL for Ollama API
   - `MODEL_DIR`: Directory for ML models

3. **Frontend**:
   - `BACKEND_URL`: URL for Backend API
