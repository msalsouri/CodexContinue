## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of CodexContinue seriously. If you believe you've found a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly** until it has been addressed by the maintainers.
2. **Submit a report** by creating a new issue labeled "Security" in the repository, or contact the maintainers directly via email at [your-security-email@example.com].
3. **Provide details** about the vulnerability, including:
   - Description of the issue
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fixes (if any)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We aim to acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours.
- **Updates**: You'll receive updates on the progress of fixing the vulnerability within 7 days of the initial report.
- **Resolution**: Once resolved, we'll notify you and publicly acknowledge your contribution (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).

## Security Best Practices for Users

When using CodexContinue, please follow these security best practices:

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly update all dependencies and components to their latest secure versions.
2. **API Security**: When exposing the transcription API, ensure proper authentication and authorization mechanisms are in place.
3. **Content Processing**: Be mindful of the content being processed for transcription. The system should not be used to transcribe sensitive or confidential information without proper security measures.
4. **Model Security**: If using custom ML models, ensure they are from trusted sources and have been vetted for security vulnerabilities.
5. **Data Storage**: Implement proper encryption and access controls for any transcribed data stored by the system.

## Security Features

CodexContinue implements several security measures:

- Input validation for YouTube URLs
- Secure handling of temporary files during transcription
- Proper error handling to prevent information disclosure
- Controlled execution of external dependencies (e.g., ffmpeg)

## Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline

Our standard vulnerability disclosure timeline is as follows:

1. **Day 0**: Vulnerability reported
2. **Day 2**: Acknowledgment of report
3. **Day 7-14**: Issue assessed and fix developed
4. **Day 21-30**: Fix released
5. **Day 45-60**: Public disclosure (after fix has been widely deployed)

This timeline may be adjusted based on the severity of the vulnerability and other factors.
