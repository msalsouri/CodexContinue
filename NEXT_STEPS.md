# Next Steps to Complete Cross-Platform Setup

Your CodexContinue project is now ready for cross-platform development between macOS and Windows. Here are the next steps to complete the setup:

## 1. Create a Remote Git Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) or another git hosting service
2. Create a new repository named "CodexContinue"
3. Do not initialize it with README, license, or .gitignore (we already have these)

## 2. Connect Your Local Repository to the Remote

```bash
# Run our helper script to connect to the remote repository
cd /Users/msalsouri/Projects/CodexContinue
./scripts/setup-git-remote.sh
```

When prompted, enter the URL of your remote repository, for example:

- `https://github.com/yourusername/CodexContinue.git` (HTTPS)
- `git@github.com:yourusername/CodexContinue.git` (SSH)

## 3. Push Your Code to the Remote Repository

The script will guide you to push your code to the remote repository:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

## 4. On Your Windows System

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CodexContinue.git
   cd CodexContinue
   ```

2. Choose your Windows setup option:

   - **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL):** Follow [docs/WINDOWS_WSL_GUIDE.md](docs/WINDOWS_WSL_GUIDE.md) (Recommended for best GPU integration)

      ```bash
      # Quick setup after cloning
      ./scripts/wsl-quick-setup.sh
      ```

   - **Native Windows with Docker Desktop:** Follow [docs/WINDOWS_QUICKSTART.md](docs/WINDOWS_QUICKSTART.md)

## 5. Development Workflow

1. Make changes on either platform
2. Commit and push changes:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of changes"
   git push
   ```

3. On the other platform, pull the changes:

   ```bash
   git pull
   ```

## 6. Important Notes

- The Ollama model will be built separately on each platform
- macOS uses CPU-only mode for Ollama via `docker-compose.macos.yml`
- Windows uses GPU acceleration via the standard Docker Compose setup
- Docker volumes are platform-specific, so model weights will be stored separately on each system
- Run `./scripts/check-platform.sh` to verify your environment configuration

## 7. Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

- Check [docs/DEVCONTAINER_TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/DEVCONTAINER_TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
- For Windows-specific issues, refer to [docs/WINDOWS_SETUP.md](docs/WINDOWS_SETUP.md)
- For cross-platform workflow issues, see [docs/CROSS_PLATFORM_DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/CROSS_PLATFORM_DEVELOPMENT.md)

Enjoy developing CodexContinue across platforms!
