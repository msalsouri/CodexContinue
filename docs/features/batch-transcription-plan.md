# Batch Transcription Feature Implementation Plan

## Overview

This feature will allow users to transcribe multiple YouTube videos simultaneously, improving productivity for those who need to process many videos.

## Implementation Details

### Components to Modify

- [x] Frontend
- [x] Backend
- [x] ML Service
- [x] Documentation
- [x] Tests

### Tasks

1. [ ] Create queue management system for batch processing
2. [ ] Update frontend to allow multiple URL submissions
3. [ ] Implement progress tracking for multiple transcription jobs
4. [ ] Add batch export functionality for completed transcriptions
5. [ ] Update ML service to handle concurrent transcription requests
6. [ ] Implement resource management to prevent overloading
7. [ ] Add tests for batch processing functionality
8. [ ] Update documentation with batch processing instructions

## Design Considerations

- The system should handle up to 5 concurrent transcription jobs
- Jobs should be processed in FIFO order
- Users should be able to cancel queued jobs
- Progress indicators should update in real-time
- Resource usage should be monitored to prevent system overload

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for queue management and job scheduling
- Integration tests for the full batch processing pipeline
- Performance tests to verify system stability under load
- Manual testing with various video lengths and formats

## Documentation

- Update YouTube Transcription feature documentation
- Add new section for batch processing
- Include examples of batch processing workflows
- Document resource requirements and limitations
