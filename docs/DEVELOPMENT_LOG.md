# CodexContinue Development Log

## Project Overview

CodexContinue is a containerized redesign of the original CodexContinueGPT application, focusing on modularity, scalability, and maintainability through a Docker-based microservices architecture.

## Development Timeline

### May 19, 2025 - Project Initialization

**Goals Achieved**:
- Created the baseline container-based architecture
- Set up Docker Compose configuration for dev and prod environments
- Established directory structure for service separation
- Created utility scripts for project management
- Defined core service Dockerfiles with multi-stage builds

**Files Created**:
- `/docker-compose.yml`: Base Docker Compose configuration
- `/docker-compose.dev.yml`: Development environment configuration
- `/docker-compose.prod.yml`: Production environment configuration
- `/docker/backend/Dockerfile`: Backend service Dockerfile
- `/docker/frontend/Dockerfile`: Frontend service Dockerfile 
- `/docker/ml/Dockerfile`: ML service Dockerfile
- `/docker/ml/Dockerfile.jupyter`: Jupyter integration Dockerfile
- `/scripts/docker-build.sh`: Docker image build utility
- `/scripts/init-project.sh`: Project initialization script
- `/scripts/setup-service.sh`: New service setup utility
- `/scripts/sync-from-original.sh`: Original project sync utility
- `/docs/DOCKER.md`: Docker architecture documentation
- `/docs/CONTAINERIZATION_STRATEGY.md`: Containerization approach
- `/CONTRIBUTING.md`: Contributor guidelines
- `/README.md`: Project overview

**Key Decisions**:
1. **Multi-stage Docker Builds**: Each service uses a multi-stage build process with base, development, and production stages to optimize for different environments
2. **Modular Service Architecture**: Clear separation between backend, frontend, ML services, and infrastructure components
3. **Non-root Container Security**: All containers run as non-root users for enhanced security
4. **Standardized Environment Variables**: Consistent environment variable naming across services
5. **Health Checks**: Integrated health checks for all production services

**Next Steps**:
- Initialize the project structure using the init-project.sh script
- Migrate core functionality from the original project
- Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
- Implement domain-specific customizations
