# YouTube Transcription API Update

## Problem Identified
The API endpoint was returning errors about ffmpeg not being found, even though the direct component tests passed successfully. The issue was in how the API endpoint was managing the ffmpeg path detection compared to the YouTubeTranscriber class.

## Solution Implemented
1. Modified `ml/app.py` to let the YouTubeTranscriber class handle ffmpeg path detection
2. Removed redundant path detection logic in the API endpoint
3. Simplified the environment variable handling

## Key Changes
1. In `ml/app.py`:
   - Changed path detection to use the YouTubeTranscriber's built-in mechanism
   - Improved error handling and logging
   - Ensured consistent environment variable management

## Testing
To verify the fix, follow these steps:

1. Start the ML service with:
   ```bash
   cd /home/msalsouri/Projects/CodexContinue
   export PYTHONPATH=/home/msalsouri/Projects/CodexContinue
   python3 ml/app.py
   ```

2. In a separate terminal, test the API endpoint:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/youtube/transcribe \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0", "whisper_model_size": "tiny"}'
   ```

3. Or use the test script:
   ```bash
   cd /home/msalsouri/Projects/CodexContinue
   python3 scripts/test-api-transcriber.py
   ```

## Further Recommendations
1. When starting the ML service, always ensure the correct PYTHONPATH is set
2. If there are issues with the port (5000) being in use, you can specify a different port:
   ```bash
   python3 ml/app.py --port 5050
   ```
3. Ensure ffmpeg is properly installed and available in one of these standard locations:
   - /usr/bin
   - /usr/local/bin
   - /opt/homebrew/bin
   - /bin

## Next Steps
1. Implement a health check that verifies ffmpeg is properly configured
2. Add better error messages for common ffmpeg issues
3. Create a more comprehensive test suite for the API endpoint
4. Consider adding a progress indicator for long-running transcriptions
