# Windows WSL Support Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of Windows WSL support for the CodexContinue project.

## Implemented Features

1. **WSL-Specific Scripts**
   - `scripts/start-ollama-wsl.sh`: Script to start Ollama with GPU support in WSL
   - `scripts/wsl-quick-setup.sh`: Quick setup script for WSL environment
   - `scripts/troubleshoot-wsl-gpu.sh`: GPU troubleshooting tool for WSL

2. **Documentation**
   - `docs/WINDOWS_WSL_GUIDE.md`: Comprehensive guide for Windows WSL users
   - `docs/WSL_SETUP.md`: Detailed WSL setup instructions
   - Updated `docs/CROSS_PLATFORM_DEVELOPMENT.md` with WSL-specific guidance
   - Updated `README.md` with platform-specific quick start instructions
   - Updated `NEXT_STEPS.md` with updated WSL workflow information

3. **Diagnostic Tools**
   - `scripts/check-platform.sh`: Detects if running in WSL and verifies GPU access
   - `scripts/check-gpu-support.sh`: Checks GPU support for Ollama on Windows

## Usage Guide

### Quick Start Process

The recommended process for Windows users is:

1. Clone the repository
2. Run the quick setup script:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/wsl-quick-setup.sh
   ```

### Manual Process

For more control, users can:

1. Start Ollama with GPU support:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/start-ollama-wsl.sh
   ```

2. Start other services as needed:

   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
   ```

### Troubleshooting

For GPU issues, users can run:

```bash
./scripts/troubleshoot-wsl-gpu.sh
```

## Implementation Notes

1. **GPU Support**
   - The implementation uses NVIDIA Container Toolkit in WSL
   - Scripts automatically verify GPU access and provide guidance if issues are detected
   - Performance optimizations for GPU memory management are included

2. **Docker Configuration**
   - Standard `docker-compose.yml` is used for Windows/WSL (includes GPU configuration)
   - `docker-compose.macos.yml` is only used for macOS (removes GPU requirements)

3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
   - All scripts include platform detection and appropriate warnings
   - Shell scripts are designed to be cross-platform compatible where possible
   - File paths use relative references from the project root for better portability

## Final Remarks

The Windows WSL support implementation provides a robust, GPU-accelerated environment for CodexContinue development on Windows systems. This implementation prioritizes ease of use while providing detailed guidance for users who need more control or encounter issues.

The WSL approach is recommended over native Windows Docker for better performance and compatibility.
