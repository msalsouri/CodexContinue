# YouTube Transcription Feature Updates

## Overview

The YouTube transcription feature allows users to transcribe audio from YouTube videos and optionally summarize the content. This document outlines recent updates and improvements to the feature.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Whisper Model Selection Now Working

Previously, the UI allowed users to select different Whisper model sizes (tiny, base, small, medium, large), but this selection wasn't being passed to the backend. This has been fixed, so now users can select the appropriate model size for their needs:
- **tiny**: Fast but less accurate
- **base**: Good balance between speed and accuracy
- **small**: More accurate than base but slower
- **medium**: High accuracy, slower processing
- **large**: Highest accuracy, slowest processing

### 2. Improved Error Handling

The error handling has been enhanced to provide more specific feedback for different error scenarios:
- Connection issues with the ML service
- Timeout errors for long videos
- Problems with the YouTube URL
- Ollama model availability issues

### 3. Progress Tracking

Added progress tracking during the transcription process:
- Shows initialization, downloading, and processing stages
- Provides success/failure visual indication
- Estimates processing time based on model size

### 4. Timeout Handling

Added timeout handling for long videos:
- Dynamic timeout based on the selected model size
- Clear error messages when timeouts occur
- Suggestions for handling timeout issues

## Usage Tips

1. **For longer videos**: Choose smaller models (tiny or base) to reduce processing time
2. **For highest accuracy**: Use larger models but be prepared for longer processing times
3. **For specific languages**: Select the appropriate language when known
4. **For summarization**: Ensure Ollama is running with a compatible model

## Technical Notes

### Dependencies

This feature requires:
- Streamlit (now included in requirements.txt)
- ffmpeg (available in the Docker container)
- Whisper models (loaded by the ML service)
- Ollama (for summarization feature only)

### Container Configuration

The feature runs optimally in the Docker container environment where all dependencies are pre-configured. When rebuilding:
1. Ensure Streamlit is in requirements.txt
2. Rebuild the Docker containers with `docker-compose build`
3. Start all services with `./scripts/start-codexcontinue.sh`
