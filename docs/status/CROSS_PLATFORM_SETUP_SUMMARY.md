# Cross-Platform Setup Summary

## Overview of Completed Setup

We've successfully prepared the CodexContinue project for cross-platform development between macOS and Windows. The setup is designed to leverage the GPU capabilities of Windows while maintaining compatibility with macOS.

## Key Components Added

1. **Platform-Specific Docker Configurations**
   - Standard `docker-compose.yml` with GPU support for Windows
   - Added `docker-compose.macos.yml` for CPU-only operation on macOS
   - Created `start-ollama-macos.sh` script for macOS
   - Created `start-ollama-wsl.sh` script for Windows WSL
   - Created `wsl-quick-setup.sh` for easy setup in WSL
   - Created `troubleshoot-wsl-gpu.sh` for diagnosing GPU issues in WSL
   - Platform-specific startup scripts

2. **Git Integration**
   - Initialized git repository
   - Added comprehensive `.gitignore` file
   - Created `setup-git-remote.sh` script to connect to remote repositories
   - Documented workflow for cross-platform development

3. **Documentation**
   - Added `CROSS_PLATFORM_DEVELOPMENT.md` with detailed workflow
   - Created `WINDOWS_WSL_GUIDE.md` with comprehensive WSL setup and usage instructions
   - Created `WSL_SETUP.md` with detailed WSL configuration steps
   - Added `WINDOWS_QUICKSTART.md` for fast setup on Windows
   - Created `OLLAMA_MODEL_TESTING.md` for testing the model across platforms
   - Created `WINDOWS_WSL_IMPLEMENTATION.md` with implementation details
   - Updated README and README-DEV with cross-platform information

4. **Ollama Model Integration**
   - Verified the Modelfile configuration
   - Enhanced `check_ollama_model.sh` to be platform-agnostic
   - Created `check-platform.sh` to detect WSL and verify GPU access
   - Created `check-gpu-support.sh` to verify GPU support for Ollama
   - Documented Ollama model usage in `ml/models/ollama/README.md`
   - Ensured model build scripts work across platforms

## Next Steps

All necessary changes have been completed. The next steps are outlined in `NEXT_STEPS.md`:

1. Create a remote Git repository
2. Connect your local repository to the remote
3. Push your code to the remote repository
4. Clone and set up on your Windows system

## Benefits of This Setup

1. **Development Flexibility**
   - Develop on macOS for convenience
   - Use Windows with GPU for performance-intensive tasks
   - Seamlessly move between platforms

2. **Optimized Performance**
   - GPU acceleration on Windows for faster model inference
   - Compatible configuration for macOS development

3. **Consistent Environment**
   - Same core Docker configuration across platforms
   - Only platform-specific differences are isolated

4. **Documentation and Guides**
   - Clear instructions for both platforms
   - Troubleshooting guides for common issues
   - Testing procedures for verifying functionality

The project is now ready for you to create a remote repository and continue development on both macOS and Windows.
